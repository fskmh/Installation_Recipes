Note that these instructions only apply if you do not have an existing instance of Anaconda/Miniconda installed.
If you have already have working Conda environments you will have to adapt these instructions to suit your setup.
1. Type "cd" and press enter to ensure that you're in the top-level of your home directory.
2. Execute the command "wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh".
3. Ececute the command "sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh".
4. Agree to the licence.
5. Confirm installation location (default is fine). If you change this make sure you also change the location in the steps below!
6. Miniconda will then unpack with some output.
7. Do not initialise Miniconda (just press enter at the prompt - the default selection is "no").
8. Copy and paste the following on its own line in your .bashrc (pay close attention to the single and double quotes).
alias conda_init='eval "$(${HOME}/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"'
9. Source your .bashrc or close the terminal and open a new one.
10. Type "alias" to confirm the presence of this alias.
11. Type "conda_init" to initialise Conda on demand instead of every time you launch a terminal.
Now follow the instructions in the Astronomaly "Super quickstart". They are repeated here for your convenience.
12. Type "cd" to ensure that you're in the top-level of your home directory.
13. git clone https://github.com/MichelleLochner/astronomaly/
14. Type "cd astronomaly" to change to the cloned directory.
15. Type the command "conda env create -f astronomaly_env.yml" to create the Astronomaly Conda environment. (This may take a while).
16. You can see what Conda environments are installed with the command "conda env list".
17. Execute the command "activate astronomaly" or "conda activate astronomaly" to activate the Astronomaly Conda enviroment.
The environment name in the prompt should change from (base) to (astronomaly). Try the second command in step 17 if it doesn't.
18. Execute the command "python setup.py install" to install Astronomaly.
